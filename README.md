A common barricade in today’s public educational system is the  ability to teach and gain the interest of ocean life in children when the ocean is not physically available. AquaLearn aims to fill that gap for educators by bringing the ocean and marine life to the classroom. The User Interface(UI) appeal will be a diversion for educational learning through interactive components. Not only will the Web App support education about ocean life but will also make the connection between children and ocean life to further enhance their understanding of their lifestyle impacts that are not directly seen. We hope to build a passion for aqua life and make an enduring connection between students’ lifestyle choices and ocean life education.
